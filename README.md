# Real-Time Parking Management System

This project engineered a real-time parking management system using CCTV footage to monitor and track parking slot availability. The system customizes parking slot detection regions and replaces manual monitoring with automated tracking to improve operational efficiency.

## Features
- **Real-time detection** of vacant and occupied parking slots using CCTV footage.
- **Customizable** pre-defined detection regions to suit various parking layouts.
- **Automated tracking** of parking occupancy for efficient parking management.
- Provides **real-time updates** on parking slot availability.
- User-friendly interface built with **Streamlit** for easy visualization and monitoring.

## Tools Used
- **OpenCV**: For processing CCTV footage and detecting parking slots.
- **Streamlit**: For building the user interface to display real-time parking status.
- **Python**: The main programming language for the project.
